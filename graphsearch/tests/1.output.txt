How many nodes does the graph have?
To add an edge, enter two nodes (between 0 and 2) separated by a space.
We assume undirected unweighted graphs here. Hence, if you add the
edge '0 1' then please also add '1 0' etc. To finish, enter '!'.
What is the starting node?
Which search algorithm do you want to run?
 Write 'a' to use DFS for the two-dimensional array representation.
 Write 'b' to use BFS for the two-dimensional array representation.
 Write 'c' to use DFS for the adjacency list representation.
 Write 'd' to use BFS for the adjacency list representation.
